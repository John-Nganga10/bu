<p>A home page (or homepage) is the main web page of a website. The term may also refer to the start page shown in a web browser when the application first opens. Usually, the home page is located at the root of the website's domain or subdomain.What's the difference between a homepage and a startup page? In reference to having a homepage when in your browser window, a homepage is a page you can set to open when you click on the “home” button in your browser. A startup page is slightly different, allowing you to launch a page when you open your browser window.</p>
